# react-native-monorepo

My personal monorepo containing my spare time projects.

Initial foundations of this monorepo were layed using [this article](https://nickhfarrelly.medium.com/react-react-native-monorepo-with-yarn-workspaces-tutorial-a55e7f4d2d86).

### Usage

- Install dependencies

```
cd react-native-monorepo && yarn
```

- Choose the app you want to run and build it.

```
yarn workspace @react-native-monorepo/APP_NAME ios
```
